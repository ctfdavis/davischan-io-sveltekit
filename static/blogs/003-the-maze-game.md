## The Maze Game

After working on a maze game for a week, I have made something that I would like to share today. My previous coding practice disappointed me quite a bit as the outcome was way below the bar I set. So this time, I didn’t expect anything lest I disappoint myself again. Luckily, through some trials and errors, I made a functioning maze game mainly with HTML & CSS. There was a little bit of JavaScript, which I only used for detecting when the user got to the final destination.

So, how was the maze game like? Instead of writing a lengthy post on that, I better put a couple screenshots of it here. If you are interested, feel free to play [the maze game here](https://codepen.io/dcufo/full/LYZXdda) on CodePen.

That’s all for the maze game. Thanks for reading!
