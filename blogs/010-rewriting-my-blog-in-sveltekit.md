You can see the code of my new blog [here on Github](https://github.com/ctfdavis/davischan-io-sveltekit).

## My First Impression with Sveltekit

It's fast. It's small. It's super straightforward. These three things combined with the fact that Sveltekit is a capable framework that can give you the same benefits as using Next.js for React, or Nuxt.js for Vue? That's what I first felt when I started learning about Sveltekit.

Honestly, I didn't expect myself to rewrite my personal website and blog (yet again) so soon (my last one was written just a month ago). But when I stumbled across Sveltekit, I had a feel that I would like to try it out on a real project -- and there's no better place than starting with my personal website.

## The Rewriting Process

It's just great. I didn't expect it to be so straightforward. This made me realize how fun developing a website (mostly frontend) can really be. When I was coding in React, I couldn't help but think the hook approach was not so clear to me from time to time. Don't get me wrong - I think React hooks are very capable, but sometimes I feel that it is not easy to fathom what someone is doing with the hooks. Especially with all the `useState`, `useEffect` , `useCallback` and so on and forth.

So when I was rewriting my website in Sveltekit, I enjoyed the entire process. The way Svelte does things is pretty straightforward to me. Its syntax is similar to Vue. It does not use a virtual DOM - Svelte is simply a compiler. And it makes a JavaScript developer really feel like they are developing in JavaScript. That's a beautiful, minimal and clean approach for front-end development.

## A Surprisingly Good Result

Since Sveltekit is so fun and promising, I put in quite some effort in designing the website. The design phase took me around five days to finalize, and then I took another couple days to code it out.

In the end, Sveltekit gave me everything I wanted for my personal website - a smooth developing experience, a fast and small build, and a structure ready for future feature addition. On the last point, the seamless integration with TypeScript helps a lot. However, there's still somthing missing right now, i.e., no TypeScript support in the template. I hope the team will fix this in the near future.

Although Sveltekit is still in early development, I think it is already capable of being used for production. In partiular, I think Sveltekit is now highly suitable for building websites for displaying content. As for web applications, I would probably have some concerns as Sveltekit is not yet mature and there are not many libraries at the moment. However, with the huge potential it has shown, I think Sveltekit can be the next big thing in front-end development.
