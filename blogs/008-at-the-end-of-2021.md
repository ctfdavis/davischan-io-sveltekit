Farewell, 2021!

## What I have learned in 2021

*Tl;dr,* below is a list of technologies (in no particular order) that I have learned this year, with my favorites marked with stars:

- React
- Next.js
- Redux
- Webpack 
- Storybook
- TypeScript ⭐
- RxJS ⭐
- SQL
- Java
- Docker
- Angular ⭐
- Angular Universal
- NgRx
- NGXS
- Ionic (for both React & Angular) ⭐
- Scully
- Node.js & Express
- Nest.js ⭐
- MongoDB

Though I am not familiar with some of the technologies listed above, I put them on the list anyway because at least I had a chance to learn and play with them.

Now comes the full story. At the beginning of 2021, I started picking up React. With 
 a modest amount of React knowledge, I got up to speed and created my first personal website pretty quickly. Looking back, React opened the door for me to become a front-end developer. 

As time progressed to mid-2021, I became eager to try out other libraries and frameworks, such as Vue, Solid, Stimulus, you name it. After trying many of them, I eventually settled on learning Angular. I was hooked by its completeness and robustness. Truth to be told, Angular took me some time to learn just the basics. However, in my opinion, the time was worth spending because Angular made me think more about how to organize and scale a front-end application.

Around the same time, I started playing with Node.js & Express for the back-end. While Node.js & Express are pretty easy to pick up and use, I found Nest.js, a framework on top of Node.js inspired by Angular, a joy to use. Nest.js has an application structure pretty similar to Angular, so I was able to pick it up in no time. Later, I used Angular Universal (for several-side rendering, or SSR in short) with Nest.js (with PostgresSQL) to build a full-stack blog site, named ngnodes, which no longer operates.

Because some time after building the blog, I realized that SSR is not an economically efficient model for hosting a personal blog like this. So I started looking for alternative solutions. I found that static-site generation (SSG) is probably a better option. So, I started learning about technologies like Next.js and Scully. At the end, I went with Angular & Scully.

## What I am looking forward to in 2022

Here is a *tl;dr* list of technologies that I am looking forward to exploring for the next year:

- Web Components
- Micro front-end
- More Node.js
- GraphQL
- Web scraping

As I start looking into web components, I think it makes sense to also look at the practice of **micro front-end**. The idea of **micro front-end** comes from the back-end counterpart - **micro service**. The gist is to create reusable components or elements that can be used across projects and frameworks.
